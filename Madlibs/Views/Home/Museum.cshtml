            <h3>Museum Story</h3>
            <p>One of the best places to visit is the @Model.Adjective1 Natural History Museum. There are lots of @Model.Adjective2 things to see there, but my favorite is the dinosaur exhibit! As soon as you @Model.Verb1 in, you're greeted by a/an @Model.Number-foot-tall statue of a/an @Model.SillyWord rex. It looks pretty scary, but my @Model.Noun1 promised that it's not going to come alive and @Model.Verb2 me when my @Model.BodyPart1 is turned! @Model.Verb3 into the main exhibit hall and you'll see that there are more than @Model.Number displays of @Model.Adjective3 dinosaur bones and @Model.PluralBodyPart for you to check out. And don't forget to look up, because there are flying @Model.PluralNoun1 hanging from the ceiling, too! I can't decide which dinosaur is my favorite in the museum: the @Model.Adjective4, ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex, or the triceratops with a/an @Model.Noun2 on its @Model.BodyPart2! At the end of the day, if I've been on my most @Model.Adjective6 behavior, Mom takes me to eat dinosuar-shaped @Model.PluralFood1 in the museum's cafeteria. It sure beats the dinosaurs eating me!</p>
