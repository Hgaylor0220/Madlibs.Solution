<h3>@Model.Name's Bear Advice</h3>
<p>If you go to some @Model.Adjective1 place like Yellowstone National @Model.Noun1, you must know how to deal with the wild animals such as bears and wolves and @Model.PluralNoun1. The most important of these is the bear. There are three kinds of bears: the grizzly bear, the @Model.Adjective2 bear, and the @Model.Adjective3 bear. Bears spend most of their time @Model.VerbIng1 or @Model.VerbIng2. They look very @Model.Adjective4, but if you make them @Model.Adjective5, they might bite your @Model.Noun2. Bears will come up to your car and beg for @Model.PluralFood1. They will stand on their hind legs and clap their @Model.BodyPart together and pretend to be @Model.Adjective6. But do not get out of your @Model.Vehicle or offer the bears @Model.PluralFood2 or @Model.PluralFood3. This same advice applies to other wild creatures such as @Model.Alive1 and @Model.Alive2. Remember all these rules and you will spend your vacation @Model.Adverb and not get eaten by @Model.PluralNoun2.</p>
